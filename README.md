# Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Overview
The Hand Gesture Recognition System is a computer vision-based application that detects and classifies hand gestures in real-time using a live webcam feed. This system identifies gestures such as "thumbs up," "thumbs down," "peace," "stop," and more, making it ideal for use in applications involving human-computer interaction and assistive technology.

# Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Detection**: Identifies hand gestures instantly through live video.
- **Multi-Hand Support**: Recognizes gestures for both hands independently.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes a confidence threshold to ensure reliable predictions.

# Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video and processing image data.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand landmark detection.
- **TensorFlow**: Runs a pre-trained deep learning model to classify gestures.
- **NumPy**: Efficiently handles data manipulation.
